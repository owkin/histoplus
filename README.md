## Overview

HistoPLUS addresses critical challenges in analyzing tumor microenvironments (TME) on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained histopathology slides. Existing methods suffer from poor performance on understudied cell types and limited cross-domain generalization, hindering comprehensive TME analysis.

**Why it matters:**
- Cell detection, segmentation, and classification are fundamental for understanding tumor biology
- Current methods fail on rare cell types not well-represented in public datasets
- Cross-institutional and cross-indication performance remains limited

**Our approach:**
HistoPLUS introduces a CellViT architecture incorporating a state-of-the-art specialized foundation model and trained on a novel and carefully curated pan-cancer dataset of 108,722 nuclei spanning 13 distinct cell types. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance while using significantly fewer parameters, enabling robust analysis of both common and understudied cell populations.


## Key Features

- üéØ **Unprecedented performances**: Demonstrates 5.2% improvement in detection quality and 23.7% improvement in overall F1 classification score
- üìä **13 cell types**: Improves cell type coverage by enabling the study of 7 previously understudied populations
- üß† **State-of-the-art Foundation Models**: Integrates the latest specialized Pathology Foundation Models
- üåê **Cross-domain robustness**: Validated across 6 independent cohorts, including 2 unseen oncology indications
- ‚ö° **Efficient inference**: 5x fewer parameters than competing methods
- üîß **Easy deployment**: Simple CLI and Python API
- üìÅ **Multiple formats**: Supports various whole slide image formats
- üî¨ **Adaptable to multiple magnification**: Supports 20x and 40x magnification

## Technology Stack & Model Details

- **OpenSlide**: ‚â•1.3.1 for WSI processing
- **TIMM**: 1.0.8 for transformer backbones
- **XFormers**: ‚â•0.0.29 for efficient attention

**Input/Output Formats:**

from histoplus.helpers.tissue_detection import detect_tissue_on_wsi

MPP = 0.25  # If available, otherwise set to 0.5
INFERENCE_IMAGE_SIZE = 784

slide = openslide.open_slide("./TCGA-G2-A2EC-01Z-00-DX4.8E4382A4-71F9-4BC3-89AA-09B4F1B54985.svs")

tissue_coords, dz_level = detect_tissue_on_wsi(slide)

segmentor = CellViTSegmentor.from_histoplus(
    mpp=MPP,
    mixed_precision=True,
    inference_image_size=INFERENCE_IMAGE_SIZE,
)

# Process a whole slide image
results = extract(
    slide=slide,
    coords=tissue_coords,
    deepzoom_level=dz_level,
    segmentor=segmentor,
    batch_size=32,

## Evaluation & Metrics

### Performance in External Validation
![Comparison Figure](docs/scatter_plot_fig.png)
*Comparison of CellViT models with different backbones based on detection quality, classification performance
and model size confirm the superiority of pathology-specific encoders on external set.  The CellViT model with the H0-mini encoder emerges as the best trade-off, combining strong
detection and classification performance with a compact architecture.*

### Per-Cell-Type Performance
![Comparison Figure](docs/comparison_metrics.png)
*HistoTRAIN dataset enables the analysis of 13 cell types and HistoPLUS proposes a SOTA model for detecting and classifying them. Performances are computed via bootstrapping with 1,000 iterations. Statistical
significance is indicated as follows: *‚ÄâP‚Äâ<‚Äâ0.05, **‚ÄâP‚Äâ<‚Äâ1e-3; non-significant differences are labeled "n.s.". Double-sided p-values
were computed using bootstrap resampling.*

## Model Card / Responsible Use

### Primary Use Cases

- Research applications in tumor microenvironment analysis
- Cell population quantification in H&E stained slides
- Biomarker discovery and validation studies

### Intended Users
- Computational pathologists and researchers
- Bioinformatics professionals
- Clinical researchers (with appropriate validation)

### Limitations

- **H&E specific**: Trained exclusively on hematoxylin and eosin stained slides
- **Human tissue**: Validated on human tissue samples only
- **Research tool**: Not validated for clinical diagnosis

### Bias and Fairness

- **Dataset composition**: Training data includes samples from diverse institutions and demographics
- **Cell type representation**: Some rare cell types have limited representation
- **Technical bias**: Performance may vary with different scanners and staining protocols

### Ethical Considerations

- **Human oversight required**: Results should be validated by domain experts
- **Privacy**: Ensure compliance with data protection regulations
- **Transparency**: Model predictions include confidence scores for interpretation
